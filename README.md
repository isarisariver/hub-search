## What it is

The goal of this app is to make it easier to search on Github. There are a lot of qualifiers that can be added to the search term to modify the results. This app provides a simple ui to pick qualifiers and explains what they do.

## How it works

Just start typing in the searchbar to see results. Click on the bar icon to open the qualifier menu and then on the + icon to pick new qualifiers. You can view and comment on issues directly in the app. 

The app works well most of the time, but might still be a bit wonky. Please let me know, if you have any issues.
